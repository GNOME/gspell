gspell development
==================

Contributions are no longer accepted
------------------------------------

And new maintainers are not accepted either.

But the source code is open, you can copy it freely and create a new project.
What I just ask for the new project:
- Must have a different project name.
- And it must be possible to install gspell plus the new project in parallel on
  the same prefix. For example by just bumping the major/API version of the
  library to something far apart.

Notes
-----

gspell follows the same guidelines and code conventions as GtkSourceView (when
GtkSourceView was still developed by SÃ©bastien Wilmet).

The gspell GitLab:

See the text files in the docs/ directory (if you're looking to integrate
gspell with *Flatpak*, it's there ;-) ).

There are also some notes on the wiki:
