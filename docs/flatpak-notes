gspell flatpak notes
====================

gspell is currently not installed as part of the GNOME runtime, so it needs to
be bundled with the app.

hunspell and hunspell dictionaries are installed by the Flatpak freedesktop.org
runtime, they are not shared with the host OS. See:
https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk/ (git grep -in hunspell).

Adding words to the personal dictionary works, but each Flatpak app has a
different personal dictionary. For example for Polari the personal dictionary
is stored in:
~/.var/app/org.gnome.Polari/config/enchant/
It works thanks to the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable (Enchant calls the
g_get_user_config_dir() GLib function).
To share personal dictionaries between Flatpak apps, maybe a good solution is
to set the ENCHANT_CONFIG_DIR environment variable to a common path (if set, it
has a higher priority than XDG_CONFIG_HOME).
