About versions
--------------

gspell follows the GNOME release schedule.

gspell 0.1.x should be installed alongside GNOME 3.18.
gspell 1.0.x should be installed alongside GNOME 3.20.
gspell 1.2.x should be installed alongside GNOME 3.22.

The 0.1 version didn't have a stable API, and there has been lots of API
changes between 0.1 and 1.0. The 0.1 and 1.0 versions are not completely
parallel-installable, only the libtool version has been bumped. Using the 0.1
version is highly discouraged.
