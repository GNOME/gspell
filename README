WARNING - API (un)stability
---------------------------

The API is *not* yet stable! There can be API or ABI breaks at any time!
You should *not* use this library unless you know what you do!

API stability will be guaranteed only when the 1.0 version is released. But the
1.0 version will *not* be completely parallel-installable with the previous
versions, only the libtool version will be bumped.

The 1.0 version will be released when it's ready, hopefully at the same time as
GNOME 3.20 in March 2016.


Dependencies
------------

* Enchant >= 1.6.0
* GLib >= 2.44
