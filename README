About versions
--------------

gspell follows the GNOME release schedule.

gspell 0.1.x should be installed alongside GNOME 3.18.

gspell 0.2.x versions correspond to GNOME 3.19 versions. The API can now be
considered stable and the 0.2 series will lead to the 1.0 version, which will
be released at the same time as GNOME 3.20 in March 2016.

Warning: the 1.0 version will *not* be completely parallel-installable with the
0.1 version, only the libtool version will be bumped. Using the 0.1 version is
highly discouraged.
