About versions
--------------

gspell follows the GNOME release schedule.

gspell 0.1.x should be installed alongside GNOME 3.18.

gspell 0.2.x versions correspond to GNOME 3.19 versions. The API can change
between 0.2.x versions. The 0.2 development cycle will lead to the 0.3 version
or 1.0.


WARNING - API (un)stability
---------------------------

The API is *not* yet stable! There can be API or ABI breaks at any time!
You should *not* use this library unless you know what you do!

API stability will be guaranteed only when the 1.0 version is released. But the
1.0 version will *not* be completely parallel-installable with the previous
versions, only the libtool version will be bumped.

The 1.0 version will be released when it's ready, hopefully at the same time as
GNOME 3.20 in March 2016.


Dependencies
------------

* Enchant >= 1.6.0
* GLib >= 2.44
* GTK+ >= 3.16
* GtkSourceView >= 3.16
* libxml2
* iso-codes

It is planned to remove the dependencies to GtkSourceView and libxml2 in a
future version of gspell.
