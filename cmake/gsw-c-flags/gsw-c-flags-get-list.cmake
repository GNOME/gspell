# -Wall and -Wextra) see the GCC manpage for the -Wall option:
#
# """
# Note that some warning flags are not implied by -Wall. Some of them warn about
# constructions that users generally do not consider questionable, but which
# occasionally you might wish to check for; others warn about constructions that
# are necessary or hard to avoid in some cases, and there is no simple way to
# modify the code to suppress the warning. Some of them are enabled by -Wextra
# but many of them must be enabled individually.
